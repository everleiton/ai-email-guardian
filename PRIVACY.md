# Privacy Policy - AI Email Guardian

## Our Privacy Commitment

AI Email Guardian is built with privacy as a core principle. This document explains how we handle data in our open-source spam detection system.

## Data Processing Philosophy

### Local Processing Only
- All email analysis happens on your local device
- No email content is transmitted to external servers
- Your emails remain completely private and under your control
- No cloud processing or remote analysis required

### Zero Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit:
- Email content or messages
- Personal information or contact details
- Usage statistics or analytics data
- Device information or system details
- IP addresses or location data

## How the System Works

### Email Analysis Process
1. **Input**: Email content is provided locally to the system
2. **Processing**: TF-IDF vectorization and machine learning analysis occurs on your device
3. **Output**: Classification result (spam/ham) is returned immediately
4. **Storage**: No permanent storage of email content or results

### Model Training Data
- The machine learning model is trained on publicly available datasets
- No personal email data is used in model training
- Training datasets are anonymized and do not contain identifying information
- Model weights and parameters are included in the open-source repository

## Data Security

### Technical Safeguards
- All processing occurs in local memory
- No persistent storage of email content
- No network connections required for core functionality
- Open-source code allows full security auditing

### User Control
- You maintain complete control over your email data
- No registration or account creation required
- No data sharing with third parties
- Full transparency through open-source availability

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub Repository
- Our code is hosted on GitHub for open-source distribution
- GitHub may collect standard repository analytics (views, downloads)
- No personal email data is stored in the repository

### Optional Integrations
If you choose to integrate with email providers:
- Authentication credentials are stored locally only
- We recommend using application-specific passwords
- Integration is optional and not required for core functionality

## Compliance

### Legal Framework
