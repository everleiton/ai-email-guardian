## 🔬 How It Works (The Science)

### 1. 🧠 Advanced NLP Pipeline

```python
📧 Raw Email Input
    ↓
🔤 Text Preprocessing & Cleaning
    ↓
🎯 TF-IDF Feature Extraction
    ↓
🤖 Multi-Layer Classification
    ↓
⚡ Real-Time Threat Assessment
    ↓
🛡️ Protection Decision
```

### 2. 🎯 Multi-Stage Detection

- **Stage 1**: Header analysis (sender reputation, routing)
- **Stage 2**: Content scanning (keywords, patterns, URLs)
- **Stage 3**: AI classification (deep learning models)
- **Stage 4**: Behavioral analysis (user interaction patterns)

### 3. 🔄 Continuous Learning

Our AI doesn't just detect - it evolves:

```python
def adaptive_learning():
    """AI that gets smarter every day"""
    while True:
        new_threats = detect_emerging_patterns()
        model.retrain(new_threats)
        accuracy = validate_performance()
        if accuracy > threshold:
            deploy_updated_model()
```

    """
    # Transform email content using trained TF-IDF vectorizer
    input_features = feature_extraction.transform([email_content])
    
    # Make prediction using trained model
    prediction = model.predict(input_features)
    
    if prediction[0] == 1:
        return "✅ Ham Mail (Legitimate)"
    else:
        return "🚨 Spam Mail (Blocked)"

# Example usage
email_text = "Congratulations! You've won $1000000. Click here now!"
result = predict_spam(email_text)
print(result)  # Output: 🚨 Spam Mail (Blocked)
